# Controlling_computing_devices_using_muscle_sensors
The main idea of this project is to perform actions using EMG sensors that are connected to micro controllers

## Softwares needed
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) -> Import the code that is in EMG directory <br />
[Processing](https://processing.org/download) -> Import the code that is in Ball_game


## Connections
